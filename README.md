<h2>Extensions</h2>
  This contains my home grown extensions for everyday use.
  
<h2>Leader Sorter</h2>
  A implementation of Genetic Algorithms to solve the problem of sorting leaders (human resources) into groups. Currently the implementation deals with a leaders friend and enemies. A test set of data is generated and each leader can have up to 3 friends and 3 enemies. Then the system goes through the process of generating better and better arangements of leaders. Until it finally gives up or finds an appropiate level of fitness. http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Genetic_algorithm 

<h2>Precomputer</h2>
  A simple computational problem.
  
<h2>Random Code</h2>
  A collection of unfisnished ideas, simple coding tests, or Wrapper Classes.
